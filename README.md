# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi there! I'm **Gabriel**, a Ph.D. student at the **Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU)** 🇧🇷.

I'm passionate about solving complex structural and multi-physics problems using advanced computational tools. My work focuses on:

- 🧠 Finite Element Modeling (FEM)  
- 🌊 Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI)  
- 🚀 High-Performance Computing (HPC)  
- 🐍 Python-based simulation frameworks

## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I'm an Aerospace Engineer and currently a Ph.D. student at the **Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU)**, Brazil.

My **previous research** involved **high-performance computing (HPC)** applied to **structural modeling**, **finite element analysis**, and **fluid-structure interaction (FSI)**.

I work at **LMEst – Structural Mechanics Laboratory**, part of the **School of Mechanical Engineering at UFU**, where I contribute to the development and validation of computational models for engineering applications.

I have experience in developing numerical methods and simulation tools using **Fortran** and **C++**, and I'm currently working with **Python-based frameworks**, such as [**ROSS**](https://github.com/petrobras/ross), for structural dynamics and rotordynamics analysis.
